# AI Standup Summarizer ‚Äì HTTP vs gRPC Performance Comparison

## Goal
Deliver a fully functional localhost app that demonstrates and compares the performance differences between HTTP and gRPC communication protocols using Serverless Framework (offline Lambdas), MongoDB, MySQL, and a React+TS frontend with real-time performance metrics and clear separation of concerns.

---

## Phase 1 ‚Äì Setup ‚úÖ
- [x] Initialize repo structure: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md`
- [x] Add Serverless Framework with `serverless-offline`

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Databases ‚úÖ
- [x] Spin up MongoDB (logs/summaries) via Docker
- [x] Spin up MySQL (users/teams) via Docker
- [x] Seed or lazy-create schema as needed

## Phase 3 ‚Äì Backend (Lambdas) ‚úÖ
### API Gateway (GraphQL)
- [x] Define schema: `CreateUpdate`, `Summary`, queries (`summaries`), mutations (`createUpdate`)
- [x] Implement resolvers to:
  - [x] Insert raw update (Mongo)
  - [x] Call Summarizer service over HTTP or gRPC based on protocol parameter
  - [x] Store summary (Mongo)
  - [x] Return combined payload
- [x] Add MySQL connection module for future user/team lookups

### Summarizer Service
- [x] **HTTP Endpoint**: If `GEMINI_API_KEY` present: call Google Gemini AI
- [x] **gRPC Server**: Protocol Buffer-based RPC server for high-performance communication
- [x] **Protocol Support**: Both HTTP and gRPC endpoints running simultaneously
- [x] **Error Handling**: Proper error responses for both protocols

### Notifier
- [x] Stub endpoint that would build a digest for a user/team
- [x] (Optional) Integrate with Slack/Email in future

### Testing
- [x] Jest tests for GraphQL resolvers (unit-ish)
- [x] Summarizer function tests (pure function)

## Phase 4 ‚Äì Frontend ‚úÖ
- [x] Vite React + TS scaffold
- [x] **Protocol Selector**: Toggle between HTTP, gRPC, or both for comparison
- [x] **Performance Metrics**: Real-time display of request timing and comparison
- [x] Form to submit update text with protocol selection
- [x] List view for summaries with filtering by userId
- [x] **Performance Comparison**: Visual indicators and percentage improvements
- [x] Basic UX: loading/error, memoized list, small pagination

## Phase 5 ‚Äì HTTP vs gRPC Performance Features ‚úÖ
- [x] **Protocol Buffer Definitions**: `.proto` files for gRPC services
- [x] **Dual Protocol Support**: Backend services support both HTTP and gRPC
- [x] **Performance Measurement**: Accurate timing for both protocols
- [x] **Parallel Execution**: Option to run both protocols simultaneously for comparison
- [x] **Visual Metrics**: Performance cards, comparison charts, and improvement percentages
- [x] **Protocol Routing**: Frontend can choose communication protocol per request

## Phase 6 ‚Äì Performance Testing Separation ‚úÖ
- [x] **Dedicated Performance Testing Lab**: Separate section for protocol performance testing
- [x] **Business Logic Separation**: Standup update functionality isolated from performance testing
- [x] **Ping Endpoints**: Lightweight endpoints for pure communication measurement
- [x] **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between testing and business operations
- [x] **Enhanced UX**: Better visual organization and user guidance

## Phase 7 ‚Äì Local Run & Documentation ‚úÖ
- [x] `docker compose up -d`
- [x] `serverless offline` for all services (HTTP + gRPC)
- [x] `npm run dev` for frontend
- [x] Updated README with performance comparison features and examples
- [x] Architecture diagrams and protocol flow documentation
